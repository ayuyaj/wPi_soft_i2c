# Software emulated I2C for Raspberry Pi

This is a basic software implementation of I2C protocol using WiringPi library for GPIO.

## Getting Started

You will need to install Gordon's WiringPi library first. 

Download soft_i2c.c and soft_i2c.h and place them in your project directory.

If you are willing to use pins 8 and 9, notice these are hardware enabled I2C pins. So please make sure you unloaded i2c kernel modules before using these routines.

```
rmmod i2c_dev 
rmmod i2c_bcm2708
```

### Example

See file [pcf8591.c](pcf8591.c) for a quick start guide.


## Usage

Include headers file in your main program:
```
#include "soft_i2c.h"
```

Since this is not a library, you need to add the source file to gcc compile line.
```
gcc -lwiringPi soft_i2c.c pcf8591.c -o pcf8591
```

### Functions

#### i2c_t i2c_init(int scl, int sda);

Initializes a new i2c bus. The parameters SCL and SDA are SCL and SDA pin numbers. Please use WiringPi numeration. 
Returns a new i2c_t structure and set the indicated pins as inputs with pull-up enabled.

You can have as many busses defined as you need.

```
i2c_t my_bus1 = i2c_init(10, 11);
```

#### void i2c_start(i2c_t bus);

Sends a I2C start signal to the bus passed as parameter. As a result, it drives both lines low. It does not return anything.

```
i2c_start(my_bus);
```

#### void i2c_stop(i2c_t bus);

Sends a I2C start signal to the bus passed as parameter. After that, both lines are released. It does not return anything.

```
i2c_stop(my_bus);
```

#### void i2c_send_bit(i2c_t bus, int bit);

Sends one bit through the bus. If second argument is true, it sends one. Zero in other case. 
Can be used to send an ack from the master. It does not return anything.

```
i2c_send_bit(my_bus, 1);
```

#### int i2c_read_bit(i2c_t bus);

Reads one bit and returns it. It is not much useful on its own but used by i2c_read_byte to receive the acknowledge bit.

```
status = i2c_read_bit(my_bus);
```

#### int i2c_send_byte(i2c_t bus, uint8_t byte);

Sends 8 bits (1 byte) through the bus passed as argument. Returns 1 if the slave ack'ed the byte, 0 if error.
Remember I2C bytes are sent or received MSB first.

```
ack = i2c_send_byte(my_bus, control);
```

For example, to test if there is a device with address 0x48 you can do this:

```
i2c_t my_bus1 = i2c_init(9, 8);

i2c_start(my_bus);

if (i2c_send_byte(my_bus, 0x48 << 1 | 1))
	puts("Device found!");

i2c_stop(my_bus);
```


#### uint8_t i2c_read_byte(i2c_t bus);

Reads a byte from the bus and returns it. But NOT ack the byte. You must ack the byte using i2c_send_bit as you wish.
Remember I2C bytes are sent or received MSB first.

```
int byte = i2c_read_byte(i2c);

if (we_liked(byte)) {
	i2c_send_bit(i2c, 0); // 0 is a positive ack
	printf("We read: %d\n", byte);
}
else {
	i2c_send_bit(i2c, 1); // 1 is NOT acknowledge
	printf("We didn't like the byte.\n");
}

```


## Known bugs and limitations

* Currently only bits and 8 bits registers are supported.
* Delays are CPU loops.
* Low speed, 100kHz frequency.
* Only master mode.
* Does not check the bus before start.
* Clock stretching is not implemented.
